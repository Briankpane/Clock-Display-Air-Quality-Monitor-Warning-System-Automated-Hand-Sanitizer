This project combines a clock, air quality display, and hand sanitation device into a multifunctional system designed to enhance public health and safety while raising environmental awareness. The device is also designed as an alert system to warn people nearby when air quality is poor. By combining these functionalities into a compact, user-friendly design, the project aims to address modern concerns about health and environmental well-being.

Note: The code is split into sections for each component( clock display section, air quality monitor section & automated hand sanitizer section)

Components List: 

- MATLAB software
- Arduino grove kit, specifically;
- SSD1315 OLED screen display
- Light Sensor
- SGP30 CO2 sensor
- 9V Battery
- Mosfet
- Pump
- Tube
- LED light
- Sound buzzer
- Flashlight
- Hand sanitizer

Technical Requirements: 

- Monitor current CO2 levels in ppm
- Display the CO2 levels onto the OLED screen 
- Record the current time in hh:mm
- Display the current time on the OLED screen in hh:mm
- Alternate between air monitor display and clock display on the OLED screen
- Activate a warning system when elevated CO2 levels detected
- Dispense hand sanitizer in an automated fashion
